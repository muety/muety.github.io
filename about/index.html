    <h1 id="About"><a href="#About" class="headerlink" title="About"></a>About</h1><p>Hey and welcome üëã I‚Äôm Ferdi, 30 years old, based in Karlsruhe, Germany and passionate about anything related to computers, software, technology and science. I love to write efficient and well-architectured code to automate task and solve real-world problems and I‚Äôm a big fan of open-source.</p>
<p>I got into tech back when starting my studies on <a href="https://informationswirtschaft.org/">information engineering and management</a> at <a href="https://kit.edu/">Karlsruhe Institute of Technology</a> in 2012 and sought to improve my skills and knowledge ever since. After a couple of internships and student jobs (at <a href="https://inovex.de/">Inovex</a>, <a href="https://artiminds.com/">ArtiMinds</a> and <a href="https://vwiecc.com/">Volkswagen Group of America</a>) and after my graduation as a M.Sc. in 2020, I worked as a professional software- &#x2F; data engineer and project lead at <a href="https://frachtwerk.de/">Frachtwerk</a> and climate-tech startup <a href="https://orbio.earth/">Orbio</a>. </p>
<p>On the technical side, I did full-stack web (primarily Java &#x2F; Spring, Go, TypeScript), geo-spatial (GIS) data engineering (mainly Python, PostGIS, etc.), as well as sysadmin and DevOps tasks (using Docker, Terraform, Ansible &amp; Co.). </p>
<p>In Feb 2023, I went back to KIT and started my PhD on the topics of autonomous driving at the chair of Prof. Z√∂llner on <a href="https://aifb.kit.edu/web/Angewandte_Technisch-Kognitive_Systeme/en">Applied Technical-Cognitive Systems</a>, Institute of Applied Informatics and Formal Description Methods. Check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferdinand-m%C3%BCtsch/details/skills/">LinkedIn</a> for more ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Besides, I‚Äôm passionately working on a couple of <a href="https://github.com/muety">open-source projects</a> and founded <a href="https://server.camp/">server.camp</a> with two friends. In my time off, I enjoy <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/76078245">running</a>, biking and snowboarding (when there is snow in Germany‚Ä¶) and I love to cook!</p>
<p>But first and foremost, I continuously seek to improve, acquire new skills and get into new topics, because I think people should <strong>never stop learning!</strong></p>
<h2 id="Project-Wishlist"><a href="#Project-Wishlist" class="headerlink" title="Project Wishlist"></a>Project Wishlist</h2><p>As someone who loves coding, I have an almost endless list of small and bigger projects that I‚Äôd like to work on some day. Of course, I will never get to actually finishing that list (especially as it grows faster than I can tick things off). But the following are some high level project ideas, problems or fields I‚Äôd love to be working on at some point.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Large scale energy monitoring- &#x2F; management:</strong> As mentioned before, I‚Äôm quite excited about energy informatics and had a lot of fun <a href="/energy-monitoring-pt-1-ir-readers-sml-mqtt-node-red-prometheus-grafana.html">building</a> my own electricity monitoring setup. I‚Äôd love to take this onto another level and work on a project in the context of industrial IoT, smart grids or the like - with thousands of metering devices connected, complex decision- and management logic involved, sophisticated data processing, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Application of GNNs to power grids:</strong> During my research, I got quite deeply involved with graph neural networks and realized that they‚Äôre still a comparatively underexplored topic in ML, yet with very promising applications in any kind of system that can naturally be modeled as a network of nodes and edges. Primarily inspired by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02827">this paper</a>, I learned about the potentials of GNNs for optimal power flow (OPF)- or cascading failure prediction in electrity grids and would love to take them for a spin for such!</li>
<li><strong>Real-world GIS use cases:</strong> Another field that got me hooked  is geoinformatics. I got to dive into GIS topics during my time at Orbio and even though I quit my job with them in favor of my PhD, I‚Äôd love to get another chance to be working on geodata processing projects on a large scale some time. There is incredibly great software tooling out there and I‚Äôd love to take it for a spin.</li>
<li><strong>Game servers and low-latency networking:</strong> This is even a totally different topic, but nevertheless super appealing to me. I‚Äôd love to have a real-world use case to implement a game server &#x2F; backend at some point. I love reading blog posts where engineers come up with very specific, low-level optimizations to compute- or networking code (e.g. <a href="https://technology.riotgames.com/news/fixing-internet-real-time-applications-part-i">here</a> and <a href="https://technology.riotgames.com/news/peeking-valorants-netcode">here</a> at Riot, <a href="https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/-broccoli--syncing-faster-by-syncing-less">here</a> at Dropbox or <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/09/29/why-we-spent-the-last-month-eliminating-postgresql-subtransactions/">here</a> and <a href="https://neon.tech/blog/quicker-serverless-postgres">here</a> in the context of databases). Writing a game server, in my fantasy, requires a lot of such optimizations that squeeze out efficiency, so it seems very interesting to me.</li>
<li><strong>Lanelet to OpenDRIVE conversion:</strong> This is very specific and I‚Äôm not even sure if it‚Äôs a problem possible to be solved. However, while working in autonomous driving, I realized the very specific, yet almost ubiquitous need for beeing able to convert HD maps from the simple Lanelet format to the much richer and more expressive OpenDRIVE standard. Vice-vesa <a href="/how-to-convert-opendrive-to-lanelet2.html">is easy</a>, but even though a lot of people have tried, to my knowledge, nobody yet managed to solve this ‚Äúconversion‚Äù problem. There are good reasons for that. But still: if somebody paid me for it, I‚Äôd love to give it a try - or at least deep-dive into it to be sure that it‚Äôs impossible (with reasonable effort).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Skills"><a href="#Skills" class="headerlink" title="Skills"></a>Skills</h2><p>In the following, I have put together a (non-comprehensive) list of technologies that I am experienced with (some more and some less), each with a rating between 1 and 5, defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1</strong> &#x3D; Basic experience. Have worked with it less than 5 years ago for more than ~ 1 week. Remember fundamentals, but couldn‚Äôt start a project without substantial research for getting up to speed again.</li>
<li><strong>2</strong> &#x3D; Substantiated experience. Have realized a (small) project with it less than 5 years ago. Can read and understand code and am confident to realize simple features using it.</li>
<li><strong>3</strong> &#x3D; Profound experience. Work with it almost on a day to day basis. Could realize a project from scratch with confidence. Can well explain even non-trivial aspects.</li>
<li><strong>4</strong> &#x3D; Expert-like experience. Have worked with it intesively for more than 5 years on a continuous basis. Know what‚Äôs ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù for the most parts.</li>
<li><strong>5</strong> &#x3D; Could have written a book on it (or did so).</li>
